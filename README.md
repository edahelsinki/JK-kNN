# JK-kNN
This repository contains the code necessary to run the calculations presented in our paper, Fast and Interpretable Machine Learning Modelling of Atmospheric Molecular Clusters.

# Requirements
To run the calculations, a working and up-to-date installation of [JKCS](https://jkcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (version 2.1 or higher) is needed. For plotting, you can run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
preferebly in a virtual environment.

The datasets used are available at [ACDB](https://github.com/elmjonas/ACDB/tree/master). Note that the .job bash scripts expect particular file paths for the data; you will likely need to edit these to accomodate your personal setup.

# TODO
- further description
- write instructions for running experiments
